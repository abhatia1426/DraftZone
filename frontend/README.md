# Use this README to document how your code in this folder is organized. 


# Frontend

This folder contains the React frontend for the project. It handles the user interface, routing, form handling, and all client-side interactions. The frontend communicates with the backend through API calls and is built using modern tooling such as React, Vite, and Tailwind.  

To get started, install dependencies with `npm install` and run the development server using `npm run dev`.
