# Use this README to document how your code in this folder is organized. 


# Backend

This folder contains the server-side code for the project. It provides the API endpoints used by the frontend, handles business logic, and manages data operations. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and includes configuration files, routes, controllers, and database logic as needed.

To get started, install dependencies with `npm install` and start the server using `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js`. Please note that the `server.js` is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual entry point file.
