## Introduction

Short overview of the problem, purpose, users, and goals.  
Mention if the project is original or inspired by something.

## Project Description

Summarize main features, user flow, and CRUD operations.

## File Structure

```
frontend/
backend/
Documents/
```

## Code & Logic

Explain briefly:

- How the frontend communicates with the backend
- How the database is used
- Include a few small code snippets (component, route, or DB logic)

## Screenshots

Add 4 screenshots (2 per member) with short captions describing each page.

## Setup

Steps to run the app:

1. `npm install`
2. Add `.env` file
3. `npm run dev`

## Contributions

List each member’s work.  
Example:

- Member 1 – Frontend + Backend (Feature 1, Feature 2)
- Member 2 – Frontend + Backend (Feature 3, Feature 4)

## API Setup

If your project uses external APIs (for example: OpenAI, Google Maps, or Weather API), include clear instructions for each one.

For every API used:

1. Explain how to sign up on the provider’s website.
2. Describe how to create or generate an API key.
3. If the API is paid or has usage limits, clearly mention that.
4. Note any extra steps needed (like enabling specific services, adding billing info, or setting access permissions).
5. Add where and how the key should be stored (for example, in the `.env` file).
